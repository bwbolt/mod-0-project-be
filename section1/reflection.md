## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
    - I feel pretty confident about asking questions. I always do as much of my own searching before I reach out to someone else (I think this helps one to learn better).
      But if I can't seem to find a solution I have no problem asking for help.
1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
    - `p "Hello World"`
1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
    - "#"
1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
    - Integer is a number not containing a decimal place. A float is a number containing a decimal place.
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
    - `animal = "zebra"`
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
    - `p animal`
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
    -Interpolation is the process of inserting something of one nature into something of a different nature.
    -In this context interpolation is inserting the value of a variable into a string.
    -`p "I would hate to be ran over by a #{animal}."`
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
    - The `gets` method (Or more accurately the `gets.chomp` method)
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
    1. `example_variable.split("")`
      - Splits the string value into an array, based on argument. Can be use as just `example_variable.split` to split at spaces.
    2. `example_variable.length`
      - Gets the number value length of a string, including spaces.
