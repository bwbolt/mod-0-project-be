## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

    1. My number one point was that of seeking out challenges. This point really resonated with me in that I have always seen
     the most growth in myself when I seek adversity. In the case of software engineering, it is no different.

     2. The notion of setting S.M.A.R.T. goals is the second point that really applies to what we have going on here.
     The projects we will soon tackle will not be mouse sized, they will be elephant sized. And as such we need to
     be able to to be deliberate in our approach.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

      -_DO_: I would say that I pride myself on trying to work hard enough to fail at some point. Only then do I grow.

      -_DO NOT_: I can get better with asking for help. I am prideful in that I will search for an answer for a long estimated
            before I ask for help. It's both good and bad.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

      1. ```ruby
         if a > b
           code
         end
         ```

      2. ```ruby
         if a == 3
           code
         end
         ```

      3. ```ruby
         if a == b && b >= 3
          code
         end
         ```

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
    - To execute a line of code when a conditional is met.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  - ```ruby
      if <conditional>
        code
      end
      ```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
    - In order to add multiple conditions to an if statement you would put either `&&` or `||`, depending on your application.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  - ```ruby
      if <conditional>
        code
      elsif
        code
      else
        code
      end
      ```
